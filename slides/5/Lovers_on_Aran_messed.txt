Lovers on Aran

Seamus Heaney
  
The timeless   waves , bright 	sifting, broken  glass ,
Came dazzling  	around , into 		the rocks,
Came       glinting, sifting from the 	Americans	.

To possess Aran    , or did Aran rush ,    
	To throw    wide arms around a tide.
That yielded with an    ebb, with a soft crash     ?
      

     Did the sea define the land or land the sea? 
Each drew new   meaning from    the waves collision.	
 Sea broke on land to full identity.
