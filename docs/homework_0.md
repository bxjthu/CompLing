Dear all,

Welcome to our course of Computational Linguistics! 

A detailed description of this course will be given next Wednesday when we meet in the classroom for the first time. 

Please get yourself fully prepared by completing the following tasks before class. Hopefully, when dealing with all them, you may see whether this course is your cup of tea.

## Task 1: Read J+M_1

Question 1: [A sample question for the quizzes of this course]
With an electronic application in your daily life, which has the ability to process human language, analyze what it would need to know about language to perform the particular NLP task(s)? You may refer to the analysis in J+M_1.1 as an example.

Question 2: [Play with algorithms]
2-1: Read the algorithm in the picture carefully, which is supposed to help when one wants to know whether he should quit his job. Is the algorithm properly designed?
2-2: Design an algorithm likewise, which can detect whether a sentence in English uses the passive voice. (E.g. The book has been returned.)
